<b>Hempfield Township looking to manage all of its volunteer fire departments<b/>
<br>
Hempfield Township is looking to change how the volunteer fire departments work throughout the county, with hopes of bringing all the stations under the township's management acording to <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">WTAE News</a>.  The township has 11 volunteer fire departments, including Adamsburg, Bovard, Carbon, Fort Allen, Grapeville, Hannastown, Hempfield #2, High Park, Midway/St. Clair, North Hempfield, and West Point.
<br>
The Hempfield Board of Supervisors is proposing the departments become non-chartered. This would allow the township to fully manage the departments and fund them entirely.
One of the main goals, Hempfield Township Manager Aaron Siko said, is to have volunteers focus on emergency calls and not fundraising.
<br>
<blockquote>What we've created is a situation where the township provides the funding to operate. The departments and the firefighters have to do less fundraising, less ticket sales. They don't have to operate clubs he said. This also means if stations decide to give up their charter, for example, Fort Allen, then they would not be permitted to keep their social club.<blockquote/>

In 2021, North Hempfield gave up its charter and is the only department managed by the township as of right now. Siko said there are other departments interested.
