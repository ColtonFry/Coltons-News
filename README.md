<h2><b>Hempfield Township looking to manage all of its volunteer fire departments</b>
<h4>
Hempfield Township is looking to change how the volunteer fire departments work throughout the county, with hopes of bringing all the stations under the township's management according to. The township has 11 volunteer fire departments, including Adamsburg, Bovard, Carbon, Fort Allen, Grapeville, Hannastown, Hempfield #2, High Park, Midway/St. Clair, North Hempfield, and West Point.
<br><br/>
The Hempfield Board of Supervisors is proposing the departments become non-chartered. This would allow the township to fully manage the departments and fund them entirely.
One of the main goals, Hempfield Township Manager Aaron Siko said, <q>is to have volunteers focus on emergency calls and not fundraising<q/>.

What we've created is a situation where the township provides the funding to operate. The departments and the firefighters have to do less fundraising, less ticket sales. They don't have to operate clubs he said. This also means if stations decide to give up their charter, for example, Fort Allen, then they would not be permitted to keep their social club.

In 2021, North Hempfield gave up its charter and is the only department managed by the township as of right now. Siko said there are other departments interested. "We have a letter of intent from the Midway/St. Clair Fire Department, which is looking to come all in to this system. And we're expecting another letter which we hope here to get in the first quarter," he said.

Hempfield Township fire chief Anthony Kovacic said <q>if this does happen, some fire departments may need to change for efficiency purposes. Fire stations may change in order to be able to cover adequately. When I say change, I mean location change. They'll still cover that geographical area, but not necessarily be in the same location they are right now,</q> he said. Siko said <q>that moving to a central fire department and having three zones set up, supported by multiple stations, it will help when responding to calls</q> <q>At that point, we can provide the best overall coverage and in doing so, encourage the other stations, the chartered stations, to come into the non-chartered platform,</q> he said.

Kovacic told Pittsburgh's Action News 4 that the township does have some money in the budget for part-time firefighters.<q>There is some money to fund part-time firefighters that would be able to be here specifically in the daylight hours. That's that's when we're hurting,</q> he said.

The township plans to hold a fireman forum in March where they can discuss concerns and opportunities with this plan.
